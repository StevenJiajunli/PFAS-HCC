# Decoding per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in hepatocellular carcinoma: A multi-omics and computational toxicology approach
# ðŸ§¬PFASRHSig: Computational Toxicology, Machine Learning-Based Prognostic Modeling and Multi-Omics Analysis of PFAS Targets
This project aims to develop a PFASRHSig composite machine learning model based on core PFAS-related genes for prognostic analysis. By integrating single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we further explore the biological distribution and functional roles of PFAS targets within the tumor microenvironment. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model construction, validation, and visualization, providing a comprehensive pipeline suitable for computational toxicology and cancer multi-omics research.

We have uploaded core codes for (a) PFASRHSig establishment and validation, (b) single cell landscape construction and (c) characterization of the expression patterns of PFAS core targets, as well as additional functions for visualization.

Have fun!
